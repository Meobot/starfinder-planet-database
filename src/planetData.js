			description:
				"Magnificent Arl is one of the oldest and largest cities on Akiton, having stood atop the Arlkari Plateau for millennia before the Gap. Its equivalent to kings, called thuroks, ruled the plateau for ages before being deposed, and as can best be reconstructed, Arl’s rulers were largely figureheads in a parliamentary thurokracy during the Gap. Since the thasteron crash, Akiton has become increasingly dangerous, and a military coup reinstated the thurok as a supreme ruler. The current thurok, Vahal Ayos (N male human soldier), favors bold shows of force over sustained recovery, often sending warriors to crush nearby raiding parties or posting bounties on dangerous fauna anywhere near Arl. The city rebooted its manufacturing industry, though it struggles to remain",
