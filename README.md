Phase 1: Project Setup and Planning **COMPLETE**

    Define the project's goals, features, and scope.
    Decide on the technologies you'll use (e.g., React, Firebase, etc.).
    Set up a new React project using a tool like Create React App.
    Create a high-level design of the user interface, including components for browsing planets and viewing details.

Phase 2: Data Setup **COMPLETE**

     Determine the data structure for planet attributes (atmosphere, climate, inhabitants, etc.).
    Set up a Firebase project to store planet data (or use a different backend solution if preferred).
    Create a collection in Firebase to hold planet documents.

Phase 3: Frontend Development

    Create a navigation bar or sidebar component for browsing different planet categories (e.g., habitable, gas giants, etc.).
    Implement a planet listing component that fetches and displays a list of planets from Firebase.
    Design individual planet pages that show detailed information about each planet.
    Add routing using React Router to navigate between planet listings and individual planet pages.

Phase 4: Planet Listing

    Display a list of planets using cards or tiles, showing basic information like name and image.
    Implement filtering options to allow users to filter planets by attributes like atmosphere, climate, and inhabitants.

Phase 5: Individual Planet Pages

    Design individual planet pages with sections for different attributes (e.g., atmosphere, climate, inhabitants).
    Fetch and display detailed planet information from Firebase based on the selected planet.

Phase 6: User Interaction

    Implement a search bar that allows users to search for planets by keywords.
    Add the ability for users to mark planets as favorites and create collections.
    Design and implement a comparison feature where users can select and compare attributes of multiple planets.

Phase 7: User Authentication

    Set up Firebase authentication to allow users to create accounts and log in.
    Implement user authentication to enable users to save favorites and collections securely.

Phase 8: Styling and UI/UX Refinement

    Style the application using CSS, and consider using a UI library for added styling components.
    Ensure the application is responsive and works well on different devices and screen sizes.
    Refine the user interface based on feedback and usability testing.

Phase 9: Testing and Debugging

    Test the application thoroughly, checking for bugs, errors, and usability issues.
    Conduct user testing to gather feedback and make improvements based on user experiences.

Phase 10: Deployment

    Deploy the web application to a hosting platform (e.g., Firebase Hosting, Netlify, Vercel).
    Make sure the deployed application is accessible and performs well.
